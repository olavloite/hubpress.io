Google Cloud Spanner is Google's horizontally scalable, globally consistent, relational database service. Cloud Spanner claims to be https://cloud.google.com/spanner/[the first and only relational database service that is both strongly consistent and horizontally scalable]. Cloud Spanner supports transactions and SQL queries and could in theory be used with any application currently running on other relational databases. This tutorial will guide you through the steps needed to set up a test environment for developing a Spring Boot application with Cloud Spanner as its data source using JPA/Hibernate.

== Step 1: Create a Cloud Spanner test database
Google kindly offers a $300 in free credit for trying out Cloud Spanner. Go to https://cloud.google.com/spanner/ and click on Try It Free to create a test instance. Go through the registration process and then follow these steps to create a Cloud Spanner instance and database:

. If you register for the first time with Google Cloud, Google automatically creates a project for you with the title 'My first project' and a generated project id. Rename this project to something like `cloudspanner-test`. If you already have a Google Cloud account, you can add a new project.
. Click on the main menu button in the top left corner next to the text Google Cloud Platform and select Spanner. Google will now initialize Cloud Spanner for your project.
. Create an instance with these values:
  * Instance name: `Test Instance`
  * Instance id: `test-instance`
  * Configuration: your choice
  * Nodes: 1
. Create a database with these values:
  * Database name: test-database
  * Tables: Do not create any tables now
. Now we will create a service account that you can use to access the database remotely. Click on the main menu button in the top left corner and select IAM & Admin.
. Click on Service accounts in the menu on the left.
. Click on Create Service Account on top of the page.
. Name the service account `spanner` and select the role Cloud Spanner | Cloud Spanner Admin. Turn on the option *Furnish a private key* and choose JSON. This key file will be downloaded to your computer and you will need it to access the database remotely. Click on Create.

That's it! You have now created the Google Cloud Spanner database needed for this tutorial.
