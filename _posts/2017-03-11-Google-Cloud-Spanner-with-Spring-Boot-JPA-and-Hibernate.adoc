Google Cloud Spanner is Google's horizontally scalable, globally consistent, relational database service. Cloud Spanner claims to be https://cloud.google.com/spanner/[the first and only relational database service that is both strongly consistent and horizontally scalable]. Cloud Spanner supports transactions and SQL queries and could in theory be used with any application currently running on other relational databases. This tutorial will guide you through the steps needed to set up a test environment for developing a Spring Boot application with Cloud Spanner as its data source using JPA/Hibernate.

== Step 1: Create a Cloud Spanner test database
Google kindly offers a $300 in free credit for trying out Cloud Spanner. Go to https://cloud.google.com/spanner/ and click on Try It Free to create a test instance. Go through the registration process and then follow these steps to create a Cloud Spanner instance and database:
.If you register for the first time with Google Cloud, Google automatically creates a project for you with the title 'My first project' and project id (or equivalent in your local language). Rename this project to something like `cloudspanner-test`.
